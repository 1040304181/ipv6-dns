# ipv6-host

Using this host file, you can access to google, google scholar, google translation, youtube, facebook in China domain.

However, we can not watch the videos in Youtube, and I am still working on it.

# How to do?

Replace the **hosts** file in specific folder with the **hosts** file in the github.

That's all, and enjoy Google in ipv6.
